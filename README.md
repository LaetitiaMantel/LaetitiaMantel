 # *Hi, I'm Laetitia Mantel :wave: !*

I'm a :fr: french developer who completed intensive web development training at O'Clock. 

During this training, I acquired, among others, a solid understanding of
![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) ,
![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) ,
![JavaScript](	https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E) ,
![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-777BB4?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white) and SQL.

In addition, I deepened my knowledge by following a specialization on the 
![Symfony](https://img.shields.io/badge/Symfony-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=Symfony&logoColor=white) framework. 

With these skills, I am now impatient to dive into the fascinating :earth_americas: world of development and contribute to innovative projects.

See you soon :nerd_face: :computer:
