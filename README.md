 # *Hi, I'm Laetitia Mantel :wave: !*

I'm a :fr: french developer who completed intensive web development training at O'Clock. 

During this training, I acquired, among others, a solid understanding of 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL. 

In addition, I deepened my knowledge by following a specialization on the Symfony framework. 

With these skills, I am now impatient to dive into the fascinating :earth_americas: world of development and contribute to innovative projects.

See you soon :nerd_face: :computer:
